## Overview

The challenge was to recreate a page to display various social links from scratch. I do not have a pro account, thus I did not have access to any Figma files. I was given three screenshots of the final page: one mobile, one desktop and one showing the hover state. I was supplied the color pallete.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

As always, I began by creating the individual sections and styling them one by one. Next, I ensured mobile responsiveness by adding media queries. Finally, I deployed the page to GitHub Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project gave me further practice in the use of CSS Flexbox designs. I took this opportunity to gain my practice using React and CSS.

### Continued development

I was not able to find a way to style the cursor: pointer to be black as noted in the image below. I did find some solutions that suggested replacing the cursor with a custom image, but it seemed out of the scope of this project. I would like to explore this further in the future.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great reference site which helped me remember some of the required syntax and generalities surrounding the base of a react project.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an excellent resource for finding answers to precise questions. I used it once or twice during this challenge.
